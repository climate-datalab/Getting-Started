# Getting Started with Using Climate Model Output
----------------

This tutorial assumes that you've gotten familiar with the very basics of what a climate model is (a set of equations which describe how the climate system evolves with time). Now that you've decided that you'd like to start looking at some of the output from a model simulation, the following should help you determine how to make sense of the files you'll be looking at!


### File Format: Network Common Data Format (netCDF)
Generally speaking, most climate model output is provided in a specific file format called "netCDF", which is an abbreviation for "Network Common Data Format". More detail on netCDF files can be found [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/hierarchical-data-formats-hdf/intro-to-climate-data/).


### Model Grids and Lat/Lon Coordinates


### Calendars Used by Climate Models


### Other Coordinates: Depth/Altitude
